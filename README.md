# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis Using The RFM Model
## Project Description
The focus of this project is to help the business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviours and concerns of different types of customers.
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the companyâ€™s database, a company can analyse which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
## Objectives
- Understend customer behaviour based on purchse patterns.
- Segment customers using RFM technique.
- Score each customer from 1 to 5 based on Recency, Frequency and Monetary metrics
- Use power BI to create insightful visuals that guide business actions.
