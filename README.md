# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis Using The RFM Model
## Project Description
The focus of this project is to help the business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviours and concerns of different types of customers.
Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company‚Äôs database, a company can analyse which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
## Project Overview 
- Objective: Segment customers based on purchasing behavior to identify high-value groups.
- Methodology: Applied RFM Analysis and scored customers on a 1‚Äì5 scale for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
- Outcome: Developed actionable insights to improve customer retention, optimize marketing campaigns, and increase profitability.
## Dataset Overview
